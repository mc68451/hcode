/// \brief The memset() function

#include "kernel.h"

/// The memset() function fills the first \a n bytes of the memory area
/// pointed to by \a s with the constant byte \a c.  The memset() function
/// returns a pointer to the memory area \a s.
///
/// Note that memset() is optimized for setting large memory areas, and
/// entails quite a bit of overhead to do this efficiently.  If a memory area
/// consists of a small number of basic data types (e.g., integers) it is
/// probably more time-efficient to set the memory directly with a for loop
/// (or unrolled loop).

// This implementation should work well for both 32-bit and 64-bit
// machines. The implementation assumes that it is worthwhile to align memory
// pointers and do as much as possible using aligned addresses. [This doesn't
// seem to matter on an X86 server processor, however]. It also assumes that
// it is better to avoid the loop setup overhead by a test and branch for
// cases where loops can be bypassed.

//void *
//memset(void *s, int c, size_t n)
//{
//    uint8_t byte = (uint8_t)c;
//    uint8_t *p = (uint8_t *)s;
//
//    while(n--) {
//      *p++ = byte;
//    }
//
//    return s;
