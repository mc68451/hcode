/// \file ppc405_cache_core.c
/// \brief Core cache management routines required of any PPC405 configuration
/// of SSX that interacts with DMA devices using cacheable memory.
///
///  The entry points in this file are considered 'core' routines that will
///  always be present at runtime in any SSX application.
///
///  \todo The compiler generates wierd assembly language for these cache
///  management APIs - probably due to the "volatile" asm - it may be best to
///  recode them directly in assembler.

#include "ssx.h"

/// Invalidate a range of addresses from the D-cache
///
/// \param p A pointer to the memory area to be invalidated.
///
/// \param bytes The size (in bytes) of the area to invalidate.
///
/// The dcache_invalidate() API is used to invalidate an arbitrary range of
/// memory in the cache. Note that invalidation is a destructive operation
/// that may cause the loss of information.  This API will invalidate all
/// cache lines from the line containing the address \a p, to the line
/// containing the address \a p + \a size - 1.  (If \a size == 0 this call is
/// a NOP.) It is the caller's responsibility to insure that no useful data is
/// inadverdently invalidated.  D-cache invalidation is more-or-less a no-op
/// for data either not in the cache or marked as non-cacheable.
///
/// This API always issues a sync() after the invalidation, even in the event
/// of \a size == 0.
///
/// \note For invalidating small blocks of data where some alignmment
/// constraints are known it may be more efficient to use
/// dcache_invalidate_line() rather than this API.
