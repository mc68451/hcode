/// \brief SSX stack initialization
///
/// The entry points in this file are initialization routines - they are never
/// needed after SSX initialization and their code space could be reclaimed by
/// the application after initialization if required.
///
/// This code was split out from "ssx_init.c" because it may be needed in a
/// thread configuration if threads are being created dynamically. in an
/// interrupt-only configuration it is not needed after \c ssx_initialize().

#include "ssx.h"

/// Initialize a stack area.
///
/// \param stack A pointer to the smallest legal address of the stack.  The
/// stack address is modified as the stack is aligned and initialized.
///
/// \param size A pointer to the size of the stack (in bytes).  The size is
/// modified as the stack is aligned and initialized.  At exit this is the
/// final usable stack area size aligned to the size of the SSX_STACK_TYPE.
///
/// SSX makes no assumptions about size or alignment of the area provided as a
/// stack, and carefully aligns and initializes the stack.  Regardless of how
/// the stack grows, the \a stack parameter is considered to be the lowest
/// legal address of the stack.

        // before alignment.  The stack is aligned downward, then the size is
